Project Overview

This project is my submission for HNG Internship (Stage 0 – DevOps Track).
The goal was to build a responsive, accessible, and testable Profile Card using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with all elements discoverable via the required data-testid attributes.

The profile card displays:

My name, bio, and avatar

The current system time (in milliseconds)

Social links (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Email)

My hobbies and dislikes

A refresh button and clipboard copy functionality for time

Responsive layout for mobile and desktop views
